SOCIAL APP DEMO

To run the app, open terminal/cmd:

  npm install
  npm start
  
Npm start should open a browser window with login page of the app.

This app uses the Facebook Javascript SDK to login and logout the user.
On the '/home' page you can share the page on facebook. You could if 'http://localost:3000' could be shared.
Instead, the app shares the company's home page (eponymous.co).

The primary technical challenges with this app were TypesScrpt and the new Angular2 way of doing things.
Along with working with the convoluted Facebook SDK.

I have used Material Design CSS for the UI.
